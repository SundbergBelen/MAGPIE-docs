MAGPIE: Mapping Areas of Genetic Parsimony In Epitopes
=============================================================================

MAGPIE is a tool for analyzing thousands of protein-ligand interactions at once. It generates an interactive 3D visualization from a set of protein complex structures that share a target ligand, as well as sequence logo-style frequency graphs. These graphs show all the amino acids from the set of protein binders that interact with user-selected target ligand positions. MAGPIE is compatible with both small molecule and protein ligands.
